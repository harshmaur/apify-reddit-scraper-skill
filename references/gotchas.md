Cost guardrails, error recovery and the quirks that cost real runs. Read on demand.

## Cost guardrails

`harshmaur/reddit-scraper` is `PAY_PER_EVENT`:

| Event | Price |
|---|---|
| Actor start | $0.02 per run |
| Result stored (post, comment, community or user row) | $0.002 each ($2.00 per 1,000); $1.50 per 1,000 on plans with Store discounts |
| AI analysis (`aiAnalysis: true`) | +$0.50 per 1,000 analysed rows (`analyzed_item`); the schema says "ignored on free plans", but a measured run on a free-plan account was billed 30 × $0.0005 — count it on every plan |
| Custom AI label (`customLabels`, paid plans only) | +$0.10 per 1,000 evaluations per label |

Estimate before running. `maxPostsCount` and `maxCommentsCount` are **per search term** (and `maxPostsCount` per subreddit or profile URL), not run totals — the input schema's title says "total across all inputs", but the README and measured runs (4 terms × 8 → 32 posts, 4 × 6 → 24, 6 × 5 → 30) say per term:

```
posts ≈ |searchTerms| × maxPostsCount + |subredditUrls or profile startUrls| × maxPostsCount
items ≈ posts + (crawlCommentsPerPost ? posts × maxCommentsPerPost : 0) + (searchComments ? |searchTerms| × maxCommentsCount : 0)
cost  ≈ $0.02 + items × $0.002
```

Worked example: 5 terms, `maxPostsCount: 24`, `crawlCommentsPerPost: true`, `maxCommentsPerPost: 5` → 120 posts + 600 comments = 720 items ≈ $1.46 worst case. Estimated as a total (144 items ≈ $0.31), a $0.50 charge limit stopped the run at 241 items and two threads lost their comments. Write the per-term numbers and the USD figure into the run section of your answer (SKILL.md Step 3) and compare them with the settled cost afterwards.

| Estimate | Action |
|---|---|
| < $5 (≈ 2,500 items) | Run. |
| $5 – $20 | Say the estimate, run unless the user objects. |
| > $20 | Ask for explicit confirmation and offer a smaller first pass (`maxPostsCount: 100`, comments off). |

Free Apify plans: results beyond the plan's monthly credit stop the crawl (the Actor halts when the platform's charge limit is hit), and only the first 40 `searchTerms` per run are searched.

## The traps

1. **Post permalinks in `subredditUrls` are dropped silently.** The run SUCCEEDS with 0 items and no error. Permalinks belong in `startUrls`.
2. **Reddit search is literal.** Long descriptive phrases return nothing. Convert topics into short keywords and run several `searchTerms`.
3. **~1,000-post ceiling per listing.** Reddit stops paginating any search or subreddit listing around 1,000 posts regardless of `maxPostsCount`. Use `postedAfter`/`postedBefore` windows to walk further back; posts older than the ceiling in a busy subreddit are not reachable at all.
4. **`crawlCommentsPerPost` is on by default and multiplies cost.** So is `searchComments` (up to `maxCommentsCount` comments per term). Omitting them does not turn them off; pass `false` for posts only. 200 posts × default `maxCommentsPerPost` 200 can be 40,000 rows. Set `maxCommentsPerPost` deliberately.
5. **Search options don't apply to `startUrls`.** `searchSort`, `searchTime` and `withinCommunity` only shape `searchTerms` runs. For a subreddit URL, sort by putting it in the URL (`/r/x/new/`, `/r/x/top/?t=week`).
6. **`/s/` share links can't be scraped.** Resolve to the canonical `/comments/<id>/` permalink first.
7. **Disabling `fastMode` needs 2048 MB.** Leave it on unless exhaustive comment search inside one subreddit is the point.
8. **Dates are UTC, `YYYY-MM-DD`.** `postedAfter` is 00:00 UTC of that day, `postedBefore` is 23:59:59 UTC. Setting either date forces newest-first (`sort=new`) and ignores `searchSort` and `searchTime`; re-running the same window with `relevance` returns the same set again (30 of 32 posts in a measured pair), so don't expect a "relevance" cut from a dated run. The reverse trap: `searchTime` alone does **not** guarantee the window — `relevance` + `searchTime: "month"` returned 12 of 30 posts dated 2022 to January 2026 in one measured run (quoted phrases) and 0 of 24 out of window in two others (plain terms). "Last month" / "past week" therefore means `postedAfter` = today − N unless the user explicitly wants relevance ranking, in which case filter `createdAt` yourself.
9. **NSFW is off by default.** Adult subreddits and posts need `includeNSFW: true`; NSFW communities also only appear in community search when it is on.
10. **`removedByCategory` is the only reliable removal signal.** Fields like `removed_by` or `banned_by` are moderator-only and null for everyone else.

## Common errors

The Actor repairs recoverable input instead of failing: every run writes a `RUN-SUMMARY` record (`itemsTotal`, `items` per `dataType`, `skipped[].reason`, `inputWarnings`, `emptyReason`) to its key-value store — fetch it with `apify key-value-stores get-value "<defaultKeyValueStoreId>" RUN-SUMMARY 2>/dev/null` (the store id is `defaultKeyValueStoreId` in the `apify runs info` output, SKILL.md Step 3; `get-value` has no `--json` flag and prints the record as stored) and read it before diagnosing a short or empty result.

| Error / symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 0 items, SUCCEEDED, `emptyReason` set in `RUN-SUMMARY` | No `searchTerms`, `startUrls` or `subredditUrls` (often an invented field name like `query`); the Actor does not fail, it finishes empty and charges nothing | Use the real field names |
| More items than the date window should give; `inputWarnings` in `RUN-SUMMARY` mentions the date | `postedAfter` > `postedBefore`, or bad date format — the Actor drops the filter and scrapes the full range instead of failing | Fix to `YYYY-MM-DD`, re-run; check `inputWarnings` before trusting any dated result |
| Memory note in `inputWarnings` | Run memory set above what fast mode needs | Harmless; leave default memory |
| 0 items, SUCCEEDED | Permalinks in `subredditUrls`, or literal search miss | See traps 1 and 2 |
| Run summary lists skipped targets | Private/banned/quarantined community, deleted user, or a 404 | Terminal; report it, don't retry |
| Slow run (>5 min) | Full subreddit + comments, or many `searchTerms` | Poll asynchronously; or split into smaller runs |

## Delivery to Slack / Notion / Sheets (MCP connectors)

`mcpConnector` names an MCP connector already authorized in the user's Apify account (Console → Integrations). `mcpTarget` is the destination ID (Slack channel ID, Notion database ID, Sheet ID). `mcpMode` is `perPost` (one message per post, capped by `mcpMaxItems`, default 50) or `summary` (one digest). `mcpMessage` is a template over any post field, e.g. `"**{{title}}** ({{score}}↑) {{postUrl}}"`. Delivery never fails the run; check the run log for connector errors.
